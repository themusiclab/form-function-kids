# Children infer the behavioral contexts of unfamiliar foreign songs

This repository contains data and code for Hilton and Crowley-de Thierry et al. (2021, Under revision). You can read the preprint at https://psyarxiv.com/rz6qn. The pre-registration and stimuli are available at https://osf.io/56zne.

## Anatomy of the repo
`manuscript.Rmd` contains the manuscript and all analyses, including those figures that are generated dynamically.

`/data` contains raw data: for privacy concerns, we have omitted the raw data but this is available on request. (`discogMap.csv`) contains data about the coordinates of each song stimulus;  (`NHS_languages`) contains info about the languages of each song stimulus.  

While the raw data is not publically available. The preprocessed data is available in `/results` . Here, `preprocessed_data.RData` contains all preprocessed participants from both the child and adult version of the experiment. The preprocessing script that generated this from the raw data can be found in `/analysis/builder.R`. `selected_features.RData` contains the relevant results from the LASSO machine-classifer feature selection procedure, and this file was generated by `/analysis/feature_selection.R`
