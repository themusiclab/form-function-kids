Feature,Type,Selection,Definition,Scoring
Accent,Expert Annotation,"Dance, Lullaby","The differentiation of musical pulses, usually by volume or emphasis of articulation. A fluid, gentle song will have few accents and a correspondingly low value.","""none"" (0); ""a little"" (0.5); or ""a lot"" (1)."
Tempo,Expert Annotation,"Dance, Lullaby, Healing","The rate of salient rhythmic pulses (measured by having annotators tap the beat), adjusted to correspond with 'quarter note' equivalent; measured in beats per minute; the perceived speed of the music. A fast song will have a high value.", range: 61-205
Metrical stability,Expert Annotation,"Dance Lullaby, Healing",The perceived clarity of the metrical rhythmic structure (groupings of perceived strong and weak beats).,"Scale from 1 - 6, ranging from ""No macrometer"" (1) to ""Totally clear macrometer"" (6)"
Melodic simplicity,Transcription,"Lullaby, Healing","Variety versus monotony of the melody, measured as the proportion of notes in the transcription corresponding to the most common pitch-class.",range: 0.15 - 1
Vibrato,Expert Annotation,"Lullaby, Healing","Presence of vibrato in the singing. Vibrato is a rapid, slight oscillation in pitch that is typically perceived as adding intensity.","""not present"" (0); ""present"" (1)"
Syncopation,Expert Annotation,Healing,"The degree of of syncopation in the song (roughly equateable with 'rhythmic complexity'). Syncopation is when rhythmic accents align with metrically weak positions of a metrical beat structure (e.g.,  having accents half way between when people tap their foot rather than directly aligned with the foot taps).","""none"" (0); ""a little"" (0.5); or ""a lot"" (1)."
Maj (-) / min (-) tonality,Transcription,"Healing, Lullaby",Tonal quality or mode of the transcription (major or minor) based on the Krumhansl-Schmuckler key-finding algorithm.,"""Major"" (0); ""Minor"" (1)"
Ornamentation,Expert Annotation,Lullaby,"Melodic embellishment by the singer, usually via rapid 'passing notes' that decorate a simpler underlying melodic structure.","""not present"" (0); ""present"" (1)"
Note Density,Transcription,Lullaby,The average number of notes per second in a given song,range: 0.44 - 6.82
Note Duration,Transcription,"Dance, Lullaby","The average duration per note, in seconds.",range: 0.17 - 2.04
Intervallic distinctiveness,Transcription,"Lullaby, Healing",Fraction of melodic intervals that belong to the second most common interval divided by the fraction of melodic intervals belonging to the most common interval; 0 if there are not two distinct most common melodic intervals.,range: 0 - 1
Duple rhythm,Expert Annotation,"Dance, Lullaby",The presence of duple subdivisions of the beat,range: 0 - 1
